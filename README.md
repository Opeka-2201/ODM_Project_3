# INFO8003-1: Optimal Decision Making for Complex Problems
## Project 3: Searching High-Quality Policies to Control an Unstable Physical System
### Authors: Romain LAMBERMONT, Arthur LOUIS

This project is part of the course of Optimal Decision Making for Complex Problems at the University of Li√®ge. The course is given by Prof. Damien Ernst with the help of his teaching assistants Arthur Louette and Bardhyl Miftari. The goal of this project is to implement different reinforcement learning algorithms to control and maintain upright a single and double inverted pendulum.
